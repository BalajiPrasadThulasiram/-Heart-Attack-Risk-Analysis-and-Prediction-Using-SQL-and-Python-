# Heart Attack Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes patient data to identify heart attack risk factors. It aims to provide actionable insights for healthcare management to improve patient outcomes and maximize hospital profitability.

## Project Structure
- **ER Diagram**: Represents the logical design of the database, detailing the relationships between entities such as `Patient`, `Angina`, `Cholesterol Level`, `ECG Result`, etc.
- **Data Files**:
  - `heart.csv`: Contains core patient health metrics.
  - `heartattack.xlsx`: Provides detailed patient records, including historical health data.
  - `o2Saturation.csv`: Focuses on oxygen saturation levels for patients.
- **Reports**: Generated through SQL queries to provide actionable insights.

## Tools Used
- **Database Design**: Logical ER Diagram
- **Data Analysis**: Python (optional for preprocessing)
- **SQL**: For querying and generating reports
- **Visualization**: Insights presented in reports

## Business Problem
Maximize profitability and improve patient care by leveraging data analytics to predict heart attack risks and optimize treatment plans.

## How to Use
1. **Review ER Diagram**: Understand database structure and relationships.
2. **Data Integration**: Load data files into your SQL environment.
3. **Query Execution**: Run SQL queries to generate reports.
4. **Report Analysis**: Use reports to draw actionable insights.
